base.msh and attach.msh must share a surface identical in Element and Node positions.
Keywords:
$PLANE: x, y or z defines the plane orientation at which the attach.msh will be attached
$COORDINATE: Defines the PLANE-coordinate of the surface at which meshes will be attached. 
             Surface must be perpendicular to x, y or z direction 
$EPSILON: Search radius for matching of nodes along attachment surface
$SKIP: 2D is the only argument allowed so far. This will ignore al 2D element of attach.msh when merging the mesches.
